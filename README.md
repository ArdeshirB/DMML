# Abstract 
This report explores the classification of abalone age using eight features, aiming to categorize them into four classes. Machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees and ensemble learning (such as random forest), are employed. The algorithm used is CART with the GINI method. Over 60% accuracy is achievable in the test set, and the results are reproducible using Python software packages. The data comes from the University of California at Irvine repository. The study indicates that random forests offer better models with higher classification accuracies and lower generalization errors.

# Introduction
The use of decision trees and random forests in the 1990s for classification tasks, has expanded with growing computational power and the versatility of ensemble methods. 
Random forests improved the strength of individual trees while reducing generalization errors, though interpreting the outcomes can be challenging. 
The report applies these methods to classify abalone age into four categories using eight features, with the dataset originating from Marine Resources Division and Research Laboratories in Australia. The goal is to develop efficient decision tree and random forest models with minimal generalization error, testing their accuracies under varied conditions, hyperparameter tuning, and cost-complexity pruning. Python and related libraries are used for coding and running the models.
