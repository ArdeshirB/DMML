# Abstract 
This report explores the classification of abalone age using eight features, aiming to categorize them into four classes. Machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees and ensemble learning (such as random forest), are employed. The algorithm used is CART with the GINI method. Over 60% accuracy is achievable in the test set, and the results are reproducible using Python software packages. The data comes from the University of California at Irvine repository. The study indicates that random forests offer better models with higher classification accuracies and lower generalization errors.
